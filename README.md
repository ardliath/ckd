# CKD
 I am building a website for chronic kidney disease warriors and the parents of children with the condition.

Our goal is to create a less intimidating introduction for people who have been diagnosed with the disease and provide support and knowledge to help.

I have an issues list which I'd love some help with. The website is currently being hosted [here](http://ckd.azurewebsites.net/), I discuss requirements with the CKD community on a regular basis.
