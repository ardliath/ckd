                People with CKD have compromised kidney function. This can be from a number of causes. Some are born with it, others suffer kidney damage, while others have a gradual loss of kidney function over time.
                As time goes by the kidneys become less effective at filtering waste products from blood; water, waste and toxic substances therefore
                accumulate in the body. A minority of people with CKD suffer complete kidney failure, and require
                renal replacement therapy (RRT): dialysis or transplant.
                People with CKD are also at increased risk of stroke, heart attack, bone disease and other conditions.

                        <p class="mb-2"> CKD or Chronic Kidney Disease is a long-term condition where the kidneys don't work as well as they should. More than 1.8 million people in England have diagnosed chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition, there are thought to be around a million people who have the condition but are undiagnosed.</p>

            <p class="mb-0">My son's condition was completely misdiagnosed during pregnancy, we were prepared for a risk of PUV, not stage 5 kidney failure. Spending two weeks living in NICU was hard, seeing our premature baby hooked up to every machine monitoring his lifesigns 24/7 while they stabilised him was was harrowing. But we made it through, or rather I should say he fought his way though. He celebrated his first birthday recently and continues to defy all the consultants' expectations of him. I've never imagined being as proud of anyone as I am of our little warrior.</p>
